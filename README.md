# paddingOracle
## Ben Roxbee Cox

This project contains various files. server.py contains the "Oracle" that will be exploited. The poc file is essentially a typed out way of how the attack can be exploited by hand, with no code efficiency. The automated.py is a program in its own right, which when finished will interact with the remote server via sockets.
